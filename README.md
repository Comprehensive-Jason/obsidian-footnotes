## Obsidian Footnotes

Great idea by [jacob.4ristotle](https://forum.obsidian.md/u/jacob.4ristotle/summary) posted in [Footnote Shortcut](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/footnote-shortcut/8872).

> It would be convenient to have a shortcut to automate these steps. In particular, I envision that the shortcut would:

> * add `[^n]: ` to the end of the note, and move the insertion point there.

That's what this does. 

This plugin adds a new hot-key <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>6</kbd> that when hit will insert a footnote with increased counter and move your cursor to the bottom of the file, add the other footnote pair and lets you type away...

("6" because this is based on a US keyboard where the uptick character "^" is the shift-value of the same key. Customize hot-key as needed.)

Let me know if you run into any issues!
